# INFO 201 Movie Data Report in R

Our group decided to explore different factors into why people rate movies the ways they do. We used the IMDB database for our source of data for movie ratings, genres, years published, movie runtime, and more. We cleaned the data until we were left with movies that had ratings about 10,000. We then explored differeent comparisons and calculations with the data, then built interactive visualizations using the "shiny" R package. The complete site and reports are hosted [here.](https://ronakpatel.shinyapps.io/IMDB-Data-Report/)
